# Contributing to albert

Albert is in a very early stage of development, so you've come at a good time!  It's *basically* a free-for-all at this stage but to prevent things spiralling out-of-control, here are a few wooly guidelines:

## Reporting issues

* Check for duplicates
* Bugs are reproducible and all steps to reproduce are provided

## Pull requests

Pull requests will be gratefully received.  They'll be reviewed and if **A)** the code's sensible and **B)** the functionality serves to enhance albert, it'll be merged into *master*.

Untested code will **not** be merged.

## Coding standards

When in Go...  Please run your code through go's toolchain (fmt, vet etc.) before making a commit.  It's not the end of the world if you don't but it's good manners :)
